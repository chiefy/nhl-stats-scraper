hockey stats scraper
------------
This is a proof of concept (PoC) scraper for the new advance stats section on a certain hockey website.

Scraping may or may not be against certain ToS, so before you use this, be sure to consult the specific website's Terms of Service.

I do not condone or encourage site scraping, this is simply a programming exercise / PoC.

## Requirements
 - node
 - npm

## To Run
Clone repo and then 
```bash
$ npm run scrape
```
